# Anvex build log

Running record of the monorepo build. **Read this first after any session restart** — it is the
handoff document. Pair it with [`backlog.md`](./backlog.md) (the ticket specs) and
[`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (the architecture contract).

## How this build runs

- The backlog in `docs/backlog.md` is executed **sequentially**, one ticket at a time.
- Each ticket is delegated to a **single clean subagent**, never run in parallel.
- Every ticket ships tests for its own changes and appends framework-level conventions to
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Tickets live in **Linear**, team **Anvex**, project
  [Anvex — Monorepo Build](https://linear.app/reality-drift/project/anvex-monorepo-build-7dc988651385).
  Linear's `ANV-N` numbering matches `backlog.md` exactly.

## Environment facts that bite

| Fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| `uv` at `C:\Users\sweil\.local\bin\uv.exe`, **not on PATH** | prepend it in every Python command block |
| Stale `VIRTUAL_ENV` → `AverageInvestorApi\venv` | must be cleared (`$env:VIRTUAL_ENV = $null`) or uv targets the wrong env |
| **`uv run pytest` is blocked by an Application Control policy** (`os error 4551`) | always use `uv run python -m pytest`; `uv run ruff` is fine |
| No `node` / `npm` installed | all frontend tooling runs **inside Docker** |
| `gh` CLI installed 2026-08-28, on the *user* PATH | only shells started afterwards resolve it; older ones need the full path |
| Docker daemon frequently stopped | check before depending on it |
| Bash tool sandbox has a minimal PATH | use the PowerShell tool for uv / docker / git |

## Legacy repos — read-only

`AverageInvestorApi`, `AverageInvestorService`, `AverageInvestorWeb` under
`C:\Users\sweil\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\AverageInvestor\` are reference only and must never be
modified. What each contributes to Anvex:

- **Api** — FastAPI, sync SQLAlchemy 1.4, `avg_inv` schema. Tables `users`, `stocks`, `stock_data`,
  `watchlists`, `watchlist_data`, `politicians`. Routers: auth (JWT access+refresh), users, stocks,
  stock_data, watchlist (with reorder), news (hardcoded blob). Config via
  `settings/config.{env}.json`.
- **Service** — AlphaVantage 5-min intraday → pandas → Postgres, with EC2/Lambda glue. Becomes
  Celery jobs + an AlphaVantage client.
- **Web** — CRA + React 18 + Tailwind + react-router v6. Auth context + `PersistLogin`/`RequireAuth`
  + axios refresh interceptors. Pages: Home (already Anvex-branded), Login, SignUp, Recovery,
  Unauthorized, Research/Portfolio (placeholders). Plus the ~1200-line `binpacking` window system
  and its widgets.

### ANV-1 — Done
Commits `0ccc0df`, `9ae4224` on `main`.

Created the repo at `C:\Users\sweil\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\Anvex`: `backend/` + `frontend/`
split, `docs/`, `scripts/`, root `.env` (from `.env.example`), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
`README.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` — the layering contract that every subsequent ticket follows.
Backend skeleton `app/{api,clients,data,db,deps,domain,jobs,middleware,models,repos,schemas,services,utils}`
plus `backend/{docs,infra,scripts,tests}`. Wrote the 41-ticket backlog.

Remote `origin` → `https://github.com/sweiler6420/Anvex.git` (created empty by Stephen; `gh` is
not installed).

### ANV-2 — Done
Commit `b0ceb36`, 22 files. **Verified independently by the orchestrator:** `uv run python -m
pytest` → 28 passed, `app/settings.py` at 100% coverage; `uv run ruff check .` → clean.

- `backend/pyproject.toml` — uv-managed `anvex-backend`, `requires-python >=3.12`, hatchling with
  `packages = ["app"]`. 13 runtime deps + a 6-package `dev` group, unpinned. Ruff (line-length 100,
  py312, `E,F,I,UP,B,C4,SIM,RUF`, `known-first-party = ["app"]`) and pytest
  (`asyncio_mode = "auto"`, coverage on `app`) both configured here. `uv.lock` committed
  (86 packages).
- `backend/app/settings.py` — one `Settings(BaseSettings)` reading `REPO_ROOT / ".env"`, resolved
  from `__file__` so cwd does not matter. `extra="ignore"` lets the frontend's `VITE_*` keys sit in
  the shared file harmlessly. Secrets (`postgres_password`, `jwt_secret_key`,
  `s3_secret_access_key`, both API keys) are `SecretStr`. Properties `postgres_dsn`,
  `postgres_sync_dsn`, `cors_origins`, `redis_url`; `get_settings()` is `lru_cache`d.
- Every `app/` and `tests/` subpackage now has an `__init__.py`.

**Design note worth keeping:** the DSN helpers are plain `@property`, *not* `computed_field`,
because a computed field would serialise the embedded Postgres password back into `repr()` and
`model_dump()` and undo the `SecretStr` fields.

**Carried into ANV-3:**
- `postgres_sync_dsn` names the `postgresql+psycopg` driver but **`psycopg` is not installed**.
  Either add `psycopg[binary]` if Alembic needs a blocking connection, or keep `env.py` fully async
  (which `CLAUDE.md` §4 prefers) and treat the sync DSN as offline/tooling-only.
- `postgres_schema` (`"anvex"`) is the value `Base` must bind its `MetaData(schema=...)` to.
- ANV-4's `app/deps/` should wrap `get_settings()` in a `Depends` provider rather than
  constructing `Settings()` directly.

### ANV-3 — Done
Commit `6350809`, 12 files. **Verified independently:** 41 passed / 1 skipped (the migration test
skips cleanly with no database), ruff clean, and the throwaway Postgres container was removed.

- `app/db/engine.py` — lazily-created async engine; `pool_pre_ping`, pool sizing as module
  constants (deliberately *not* new env vars), and `dispose_engine()` for the ANV-4 lifespan.
- `app/db/session.py` — `get_sessionmaker()` (`expire_on_commit=False`) and an
  `@asynccontextmanager get_session()` that rolls back on exception and always closes. It never
  commits — the service owns the transaction.
- `app/db/base.py` — `Base` on `MetaData(schema="anvex", naming_convention=...)` with
  `pk_`/`fk_`/`uq_`/`ix_`/`ck_` templates.
- Alembic wired fully async. `alembic.ini` carries **no** `sqlalchemy.url`; `env.py` reads it from
  `get_settings()` and escapes `%` for configparser. `include_schemas=True` plus an `include_name`
  hook restricting reflection to `anvex` — without the hook, autogenerate sees `public` and proposes
  dropping whatever it finds there.

**Two subtle things it found, both now commented in the code:**

1. `env.py` runs `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS anvex` before `context.configure`, then calls
   `connection.commit()` explicitly. That commit is load-bearing: the bootstrap `execute` autobegins
   a transaction, which makes Alembic's own `begin_transaction()` a no-op nested block — so
   `upgrade head` **reported success while committing nothing**. This was hit live, not theorised.
2. The first revision's `downgrade` drops `pgcrypto` but deliberately leaves the `anvex` schema.
   `alembic_version` lives in it, and Alembic deletes the revision row *after* `downgrade()` returns
   — dropping the schema takes the version table with it and the downgrade errors.

**Carried into ANV-4:**
- Lifespan shutdown: `await dispose_engine()`. Startup needs nothing — the engine is lazy and opens
  no socket at import.
- `app/deps/get_session` should wrap `app.db.session.get_session()`:
  `async with get_session() as session: yield session`. Do not build a second sessionmaker.
- `/health/ready` should issue a real `SELECT 1`; `pool_pre_ping` handles dead connections, so a
  failure there is genuine.

**Carried into ANV-7:**
- Subclass `app.db.base.Base` only. `Base.metadata` already carries `schema="anvex"` — do **not**
  set `__table_args__ = {"schema": "anvex"}` on models.
- Do not name constraints by hand; the naming convention generates them and keeps diffs stable.
- `gen_random_uuid()` is available, and `0001_bootstrap` is your `down_revision`.
- `alembic revision --autogenerate` runs a ruff `check --fix` post-write hook, so generated
  migrations land lint-clean.
- `psycopg` was **not** needed and is not installed; `postgres_sync_dsn` remains unused.

### ANV-4 — Done
Commit `3370387`, 25 files. **Verified independently:** 138 passed / 1 skipped, 98% coverage,
ruff clean, and a live `uvicorn` run confirmed `/health` 200, `/docs` 200, `/health/ready` 503.

- `app/domain/errors.py` — stdlib-only exception hierarchy. **The status mapping deliberately does
  not live on the exception classes**; it lives in `app/middleware/errors.py`, which is what keeps
  `app/domain/` free of HTTP. Lookup walks the MRO, so a future subclass inherits its parent's
  status and an unmapped one degrades to 500 rather than crashing the handler.
- `app/middleware/` — `request_id` (pure ASGI), `logging` (structlog + access log), `errors`
  (mapping + all four handlers), and `setup.install_middleware()` as the single place stack order
  is decided.
- `app/main.py` — `create_app(settings)` factory plus a module-level `app`. `/health` (liveness,
  no I/O) and `/health/ready` (readiness, real `SELECT 1` via `app/db/health.ping`).
- `app/deps/` — `get_session` wrapping ANV-3's context manager, and `get_settings_dep`.
- `app/api/v1/__init__.py` — an empty `APIRouter(prefix="/v1")` aggregator, so ANV-11 onward adds
  routers with a one-line change.

**The error envelope is now a hard contract** (documented in `CLAUDE.md` §4). Every non-2xx —
domain error, pydantic 422, unknown route, unhandled crash — returns the same four keys, with
`details` as `{}` rather than `null` so clients index it unconditionally and branch on `code`.

**Bug found live:** a 500 bypassed the request-ID middleware entirely. Starlette's
`ServerErrorMiddleware` sits *outside* all user middleware, so it sends its response without
passing through the send wrapper — meaning the one response a client most needs to correlate was
the only one missing the header. Fixed by having `error_response()` set `X-Request-ID` itself,
with the middleware de-duplicating.

**Carried into ANV-5:**
- The container healthcheck must hit **`/health`**, not `/health/ready` — readiness depends on
  Postgres, so using it as a healthcheck restart-loops the API whenever the DB blips. Use
  `/health/ready` for the `depends_on` gate and, later, the ALB target group.
- Entrypoint `uvicorn app.main:app` (or `app.main:create_app --factory`). Startup opens no socket,
  so the API boots even if Postgres is still starting.
- Logs go to stdout as JSON whenever `ANVEX_ENV != local`, console-rendered when it is.
- The compose `web` origin must appear in `API_CORS_ORIGINS`.

**Carried into ANV-6:**
- `tests/conftest.py` holds only `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` and the `settings` / `app` / `client` fixtures —
  **extend these, do not add parallel ones.**
- `client` uses `ASGITransport(app=app, raise_app_exceptions=False)`. That flag is load-bearing:
  without it the transport re-raises through `ServerErrorMiddleware` and you can never assert on
  the 500 body a real client actually receives.
- The `app` fixture builds a fresh instance per test so `dependency_overrides` cannot leak.
- `ERROR_BODY_KEYS` in `tests/api/test_middleware.py` is the canonical assertion set — worth
  promoting to a shared helper when the harness lands.
