# Anvex build log

Status and live context for the monorepo build. **Read this first after any session restart** — it
is the handoff document, and it is kept short on purpose.

| Read | For |
| --- | --- |
| this file | current status, environment traps, and the carry-overs still outstanding |
| [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | the architecture contract — what goes where, and why |
| [`backlog.md`](./backlog.md) | the ticket specs, in execution order |
| [`ticket-log.md`](./ticket-log.md) | the archive: what each completed ticket decided and found |

## How this build runs

- The backlog in `docs/backlog.md` is executed **sequentially**, one ticket at a time.
- Each ticket is delegated to a **single clean subagent**, never run in parallel.
- Every ticket ships tests for its own changes and appends framework-level conventions to
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Tickets live in **Linear**, team **Anvex**, project
  [Anvex — Monorepo Build](https://linear.app/reality-drift/project/anvex-monorepo-build-7dc988651385).
  Linear's `ANV-N` numbering matches `backlog.md` exactly.

## Environment facts that bite

| Fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| `uv` at `C:\Users\sweil\.local\bin\uv.exe`, **not on PATH** | prepend it in every Python command block |
| Stale `VIRTUAL_ENV` → `AverageInvestorApi\venv` | must be cleared (`$env:VIRTUAL_ENV = $null`) or uv targets the wrong env |
| **A native `postgresql-x64-18` service owns host port 5432** (auto-start, PID confirmed) | compose publishes `db` on **5442**. On Windows the native server *and* Docker's proxy both bind 5432 successfully, so a host client silently reaches the wrong database with no error |
| **`uv run pytest` is blocked by an Application Control policy** (`os error 4551`) | always use `uv run python -m pytest`; `uv run ruff` is fine |
| No `node` / `npm` installed | all frontend tooling runs **inside Docker** |
| `gh` CLI installed 2026-08-28, on the *user* PATH | only shells started afterwards resolve it; older ones need the full path |
| Docker daemon frequently stopped | check before depending on it |
| Bash tool sandbox has a minimal PATH | use the PowerShell tool for uv / docker / git |

## Legacy repos — read-only

`AverageInvestorApi`, `AverageInvestorService`, `AverageInvestorWeb` under
`C:\Users\sweil\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\AverageInvestor\` are reference only and must never be
modified. What each contributes to Anvex:

- **Api** — FastAPI, sync SQLAlchemy 1.4, `avg_inv` schema. Tables `users`, `stocks`, `stock_data`,
  `watchlists`, `watchlist_data`, `politicians`. Routers: auth (JWT access+refresh), users, stocks,
  stock_data, watchlist (with reorder), news (hardcoded blob). Config via
  `settings/config.{env}.json`.
- **Service** — AlphaVantage 5-min intraday → pandas → Postgres, with EC2/Lambda glue. Becomes
  Celery jobs + an AlphaVantage client.
- **Web** — CRA + React 18 + Tailwind + react-router v6. Auth context + `PersistLogin`/`RequireAuth`
  + axios refresh interceptors. Pages: Home (already Anvex-branded), Login, SignUp, Recovery,
  Unauthorized, Research/Portfolio (placeholders). Plus the ~1200-line `binpacking` window system
  and its widgets.

## Active carry-overs

Only what is still outstanding. Once a ticket consumes one of these, delete it — the full record
stays in [`ticket-log.md`](./ticket-log.md).

**For ANV-17 (client base) — opening the integrations epic:**
- `app/clients/` is still an empty `__init__.py`. You establish that layer the way ANV-16
  established `app/data/`: put its *shape* in a `base` module, document the one exception type it
  raises, and **enforce the layering rule with an AST test over the whole package** rather than
  prose. `tests/unit/test_data_loader.py::TestTheLayerStaysInItsLane` is a ready template — swap the
  forbidden import list.
- **Clients raise `ExternalServiceError` (→ 502).** It is already in `app/domain/errors.py` and in
  §4's mapping table but has **no producer yet**. Note this is deliberately *different* from
  ANV-16's precedent: `app/data/` raises a plain `ValueError` and stays free of domain vocabulary,
  because a broken seed file is a repo defect reached from a script and has no status code. A client
  failure is always inside a request and already has one waiting.
- `app/domain/pagination.py` now holds `resolve_window` / `PageWindow` if a client needs a window;
  `resolve_page_limit` bounds still live in `app/schemas/pagination.py`.
- `respx` + the `mock_http` fixture is the client tier's equivalent of a fake repo — and a
  respx-only test in `tests/integration/` keeps running with Docker stopped.
- **Never hit a live vendor API in a test.**

**For any ticket writing a service — the sweep pattern (new, from ANV-15):**
Any property that must hold for *every* use case (auth required, resource noun stable, no commit on
a read) is better expressed as one parameterised sweep whose case list is **derived** from
`vars(XService)` and asserted complete, than as N hand-written tests one of which will be forgotten.
ANV-15's ownership sweep fails the suite if a new use case is added without isolation coverage.

**For ANV-22 (ingest):**
- `bulk_upsert` is a Core statement — it does **not** update the session's identity map. Re-read or
  `expunge_all` if ORM objects are still held.
- **No repo-level dedupe.** A batch containing an internal duplicate raises `cannot affect row a
  second time`; deduplicate in `app/domain/ingest.py` first.

**For any ticket writing a service:**
- Pre-check for the message, constraint for the correctness: keep `*_exists` so the 409 can name
  `details.field`, *and* catch `IntegrityError` — with `await session.rollback()` **first**, because
  Postgres aborts the transaction and refuses everything after it.
- Translate `app/utils/` exceptions at the service; utils raise builtins by layering rule, and
  uncaught they become 500s for input the API should have refused.
- Add fakes **beside** the existing ones in `tests/helpers.py`, and keep them faithful to the
  awkward parts of the real repo — a forgiving fake silently passes the bug the test exists to catch.

**Still unimplemented, deliberately:**
- **No mail client.** `POST /v1/auth/recovery` logs `delivered=False` and returns 202, behind a
  `TODO(ANV-mail)` that a unit test asserts is still present. Wiring real delivery needs its own
  ticket.
